# playwright_mcp
**Role:** A FastMCP-based server providing browser automation tools using Playwright, including session management, stealth navigation, and image extraction.

## 📂 Subdirectories
| Folder | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- |
| `tests/` | Unit and integration tests for MCP tools, security filters, and HTML processing. |

## 📄 Core Files
| File | Purpose | Key Symbols/Exports |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `server.py` | Main FastMCP server implementation with browser tools. | `visit_page_tool`, `browser_start_session`, `mcp` |
| `entrypoint.sh` | Shell script to start the server (typically in a container). | - |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies for the server. | `playwright`, `FastMCP`, etc. |

## 🧩 Architectural Context
*   **Dependencies:** `playwright`, `playwright-stealth`, `selectolax`, `httpx`, `pypdf`.
*   **Flow:** The server listens for MCP requests (SSE) and executes browser commands. It maintains a global registry of browser sessions to allow persistent interactions.
*   **Security:** Implements SSRF protection by resolving hostnames and blocking private/reserved IP ranges. Uses an `AuthMiddleware` to enforce `X-MCP-API-KEY` verification.
*   **Stealth:** Uses `playwright-stealth` and custom JS injection to scrub CDP leaks and spoof browser fingerprints.

## 🛠️ Usage & Conventions
*   **Session Management:** Sessions are stored in a global `_sessions` dict and automatically cleaned up after 5 minutes of inactivity.
*   **Detail Levels:** `visit_page_tool` supports `basic`, `standard`, and `deep` levels, adjusting noise reduction and scroll depth accordingly.
*   **Testing:** Run tests with `PYTHONPATH=. pytest playwright_mcp/tests/`.
