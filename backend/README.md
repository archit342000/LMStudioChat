*   **Run Tests:** `EMBEDDING_URL="http://mock" AI_URL="http://mock" AI_API_KEY="dummy" PYTHONPATH=. ./venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/tests/`

## 🧩 Architectural Context
*   **Initialization:** On startup, the system reads `config.py` and initializes core singletons (`db`, `task_manager`, `RAGManager`).
*   **Resilience:** All external calls (to LLM, Search, Browsing) are wrapped in `error_handling` logic to prevent cascading failures.
*   **Extensibility:** The backend uses MCP to dynamically load tools from external servers like Playwright or Tavily.

## 🛠️ Usage & Conventions
*   **Patterns:** 
    - **Global Configuration:** Always use `backend.config` rather than hardcoding values.
    - **Self-Healing:** `validation.py` monitors LLM output for formatting errors (like unclosed tags) and can trigger automatic "splice-fixes" or regeneration.
*   **Security:** Sensitive keys and paths are pulled via `get_secret` to ensure compatibility with Docker Secrets and environment-based deployments.
