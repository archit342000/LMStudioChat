# Research Agent
**Role:** A high-assurance orchestration agent that executes a deterministic, multi-phase research pipeline: Context Scouting, Strategy Planning, Sequential Section Execution (with self-reflection), and Final Synthesis/Auditing.

## 📂 Subdirectories
| Folder | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- |
| `tests/` | Comprehensive test suite for the multi-phase state machine, resumption logic, and JSON schema compliance. |

## 📄 Core Files
| File | Purpose | Key Symbols/Exports |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `agent.py` | Orchestration class `ResearchAgent` managing the full research lifecycle. | `ResearchAgent`, `flow_fn` |
| `prompts.py` | 10+ specialized prompt templates for scouting, planning, reflection, triage, and synthesis. | `PLANNER_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, `SCOUT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, etc. |
| `research_utils.py` | Helpers for structured JSON extraction, citation normalization, and report sanitization. | `_extract_json_from_text`, `_normalize_citations` |
| `schemas.py` | Strict Pydantic-like JSON schemas for all structured LLM output phases. | `SCOUT_JSON_SCHEMA`, `PLAN_GENERATOR_JSON_SCHEMA`, etc. |
| `constants.py` | Database event markers used for thread-safe state reconstruction. | `EVENT_SCOUT_START`, `EVENT_PLAN_APPROVED`, etc. |

## 🧩 Architectural Context
*   **Dependencies:** `backend.database`, `backend.mcp_client.tavily_client`, `backend.file_system.manager`.
*   **State Machine:**
    1.  **Scouting Phase**: Gathers initial broad context on the topic.
    2.  **Planning Phase**: Generates a structured research plan (requires user approval).
    3.  **Execution Phase**: Processes sections **sequentially**. Each section runs its own internal sub-cycle:
        *   *Initial Search* -> *Reflection* (Gaps) -> *Follow-up Search* -> *Triage* (Evidence Selection) -> *Drafting* (Writer) -> *Summarization*.
    4.  **Synthesis Phase**: Merges all section summaries, performs a global audit, and generates the final report in the FileSystem.
*   **Resumption:** The agent is designed to be fully resumable. It reconstructs its current position in the pipeline by scanning DB history for specific `role='event'` markers.

## 🛠️ Usage & Conventions
*   **Persistence:** All intermediate search results and drafts are stored as `collections` linked to the chat.
*   **Verification:** Mechanically verifies LLM output against JSON schemas at every phase.
*   **Sequentiality:** Currently executes sections one by one to ensure context continuity (later sections see summaries of previous ones).
*   **Testing:** Run `PYTHONPATH=. ./venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/tools/agents/research_agent/tests/`.
