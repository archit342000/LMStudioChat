# backend/file_system
**Role:** Manages virtualized "file system" artifacts that are persistent across chat turns, supporting multi-user workspaces, versioning, and complex file operations.

## 🧩 Architectural Context
*   **Dependencies:**
    - `backend.database`: Persistence for metadata, version history, and permissions.
    - `backend.config`: Root directories for file and workspace storage.
    - `aiofiles`: Asynchronous file system I/O.
*   **Flow:**
    1. **Mounting:** Virtual paths starting with `workspace/` are routed to shared workspace directories; all others are local to the chat.
    2. **Locking:** Every operation must acquire a `FileSystemPersistenceChannel` for the specific chat to ensure serial execution across AI and user agents.
    3. **Persistence:** Files are mirrored on disk (current version) and tracked in SQLite (all versions).
    4. **Versioning:** Edits create new versions with parent pointers, allowing for non-linear history navigation (undo/redo).

## 🛠️ Usage & Conventions
*   **Patterns:** 
    - **Virtualized Hierarchy:** Agents interact with a clean, relative path structure that maps to secure, isolated physical locations.
    - **Channel Serialization:** Prevents the "lost update" problem in a multi-agent or collaborative environment.
    - **Search-Enabled:** Uses FTS5 (via DB sync) to allow fast searching across all artifacts in a session.
*   **Conventions:** Never manipulate files in `DATA_DIR/file_systems` directly; always use the `manager` API to keep metadata and versioning in sync.
*   **Testing:**
    - **Local:** Unit tests in `tests/` ensure strict compliance with the exhaustive 1:1 testing rule, verifying path resolution, FTS5 sync, locking channels, and artifact CRUD operations.
